2. [Network Security and Types of Attacks in Network](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1877050915006353?token=492E4F63F9BF75892F48FFD593657B1AB71F87CC8707B99F7B6CE0404C569706E4282C082350AA61145A2E32B513C266)<br>
The article explains about network security and its types of attacks in an easy way. Things that are explained: mainly about network security, active attacks (spoofing, wormhole, denial of services, etc.), advanced attacks (black hole attack, rushing attack, byzantine attack, etc.).

3. [Types of Virus](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-virus/)<br>
The website gives you simple explanations about various types of virus. A virus is a fragment of code embedded in a legitimate program. Virus are self-replicating and are designed to infect other programs. They can wreak havoc in a system by modifying or destroying files causing system crashes and program malfunctions.

4. [End-to-End Encryption](https://www.preveil.com/end-to-end-encryption/)<br>
The website explains about end-to-end encryption, which is a secure and private method of communication where the only people who can access the data are the sender and the intended recipient(s). Using end-to-end encryption prevents hackers or unwanted third parties from accessing messages or files on the server. The website tells you about how encryption works, why end-to-end encryption is important, uses of end-to-end encryption, the advantages of end-to-end encryption, and more!

5. [Public Key vs Private Key](https://sectigo.com/resource-library/public-key-vs-private-key)<br>
The website tells you about the difference between public key and private key, and more in public key. It tells you about how public key & private key works, the benefits of public key cryptography, the role of certificate authorities in public key cryptography, and more.

6. [Firewall in Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-firewall-in-computer-network/?ref=rp)<br>
A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic. The website explains about how firewall works, generations of firewall, and types of firewall.

7. [Digital Signature](https://www.instantssl.com/digital-signature#:~:text=Digital%20Signature%20is%20a%20process,public%20and%20private%20key%20pair.)<br>
The website explains about what digital signature is, how digital signature works, uses of digital signature, and types of digital signature.

8. [Making and Verifying Signatures](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html)<br>
The GNU Privacy Handbook provided by The GNU Privacy Guard gives you a brief, easy to understand, and practical manual of making and verifying digital signatures.

9. [Access Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Access%20Matrix%20is%20a%20security,with%20respect%20to%20each%20object.)<br>
GeeksForGeeks gives you a good introductory explanation about Access Matrix in Operating System. Access Matrix is a security model of protection state in computer system. It is represented as a matrix. Access matrix is used to define the rights of each process executing in the domain with respect to each object.

10. [C Programming Language](https://users.elis.ugent.be/~jrvdnbro/learn_c_the_hard_way.pdf)<br>
This book (the link above) is not about teaching you C programming. You’ll learn to write programs in C, but the most important lesson you’ll get from this book is rigorous defensive programming. (Zed A. Shaw)
