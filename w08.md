# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/dotnet/visual-basic/race-conditions-deadlocks)<br>
The webiste explains about preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling including the key differences between both and the comparison chart/table. The explanations are simple and easy to understand.

2. [Difference Between Dispatcher and Scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dispatcher-and-scheduler/)<br>
As the title said, the website tells you about the differences between dipatcher and scheduler. Illustrations and tables are provided along the examples.

3. [First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/fcfs-scheduling.html)<br>
The website explains about FCFS Scheduling with an example program. The topics discussed in the website are "What is FCFS method?", how FCFS method works, characteristics od FCFS method, and advantages & disadvantages of FCFS method.

4. [Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling/)<br>
Shortest Job First is a Preemptive or Non-Preemptive algorithm. In the shortest job first algorithm, the job having shortest or less burst time will get the CPU first. It is the best approach to minimize the waiting time. The topics discussed are the characteristics, types, and advantages & disadvantages of SJF Scheduling. An example of SJF scheduling is also included.

5. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.iitk.ac.in/esc101/05Aug/tutorial/essential/threads/priority.html)<br>
The website explains about Thread Scheduling with examples. The examples are in Java, and the explanations are clear. Topics discussed: thread race, selfish thread, time-slicing, and more.

6. [Multi-Processors Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
The topics discussed int the website are multiprocessing, processor affinity, load balancing, multicore processors, and virtualization & threading. In multiple-processor scheduling multiple CPUâ€™s are available and hence Load Sharing becomes possible. However multiple processor scheduling is more complex as compared to single processor scheduling.

7. [Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/earliest-deadline-first-edf-cpu-scheduling-algorithm/)<br>
The website explains about EDF Scheduling with and example. Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is an optimal dynamic priority scheduling algorithm used in real-time systems. It can be used for both static and dynamic real-time scheduling.

8. [Round Robin Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
The website explains about Round Robin Scheduling with example. The example is provided with illustrations so you can understand better. The topics discussed in the website are the characteristics, advantages & disadvantages of RR scheduling, and worst case latency.

9. [Rate Monotonic Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rate-monotonic-scheduling/)<br>
Rate monotonic scheduling is a priority algorithm that belongs to the static priority scheduling category of Real Time Operating Systems. It is preemptive in nature. The priority is decided according to the cycle time of the processes that are involved. The example in the website is provided with illustrations.

10. [Linux Scheduler](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/classes/s06-4118/l13.pdf)<br>
The lecture slides from Columbia University explains about Linux scheduler. It explains about typical quanta, dynamic priority, linux is more efficient, sleeping and waking, and many more!
