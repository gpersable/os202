# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Process Management (Processes and Threads)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrM7nZcxXZU)<br>
The video from Neso Academy explains about process management (processes and threads) in operating systems. Topics discussed: process management, processes, threads, and the difference between processes and threads.

2. [Inter-Process Communication (IPC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br>
The website explains about IPC comprehensively. Inter process communication (IPC) is a mechanism which allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions. If you want to know more, just click the link above.

3. [Shared Memory](http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/shm/what-is-shm.html)<br>
The website explains about shared memory. A shared memory is an extra piece of memory that is attached to some address spaces for their owners to use. As a result, all of these processes share the same memory segment and have access to it.

4. [Message Passing](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos318/lectures/MessagePassing.pdf)<br>
Princeton University gives good explanations and lectures about Message Passing. The lectures are detailed and comprehensive, and also equipped with many illustrations so we can understand better.

5. [Socket in Computer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-in-computer-network/)<br>
GFG gives a good explanation about sockets in a simple way. A socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the network. The socket mechanism provides a means of inter-process communication (IPC) by establishing named contact points between which the communication take place.

6. [Forks and Execs](https://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/330/Fork/fork.html)<br>
The website explains about fork(), execlp(), wait(), and more. It provides many examples too. Topics explained: Shell Commands for Process Control and System Calls for Process Control.

7. [Remote Procedure Call (RPC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/)<br>
The website explains about the making of an RPC, working of RPC, RPC issues, RPC advantages, and more. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a powerful technique for constructing distributed, client-server based applications.

8. [Threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOfGJcVnvAk)<br>
Neso Academy gives nice explanations about threads. The topics discussed in the video are threads, single-threaded process, multi-threaded process, and the benefits of multi-threaded programming.

9. [Concurrency vs Parallelism](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/concurrency-vs-parallelism.html)<br>
The terms concurrency and parallelism are often used in relation to multithreaded programs. At first it may seem as if concurrency and parallelism may be referring to the same concepts. However, concurrency and parallelism actually have different meanings. The website in the link above explains what these concepts mean.

10. [Race Conditions and Critical Sections](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-concurrency/race-conditions-and-critical-sections.html)<br>
A race condition is a concurrency problem that may occur inside a critical section. A critical section is a section of code that is executed by multiple threads and where the sequence of execution for the threads makes a difference in the result of the concurrent execution of the critical section. The website elaborates more on race conditions and critical sections.
