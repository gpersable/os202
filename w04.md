# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Logical vs. Physical Address Space](https://microcontrollerslab.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-systems/)<br>
The website explains about logical address, physical address, and their differences. It also explains about mapping of address and base & bound approach. It provides illustrations with the explanations so you can understand better.

2. [Memory Management Unit (MMU)](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/learn-the-architecture/memory-management/the-memory-management-unit-mmu)<br>
The website tells you about MMU with a brief yet comprehensive explanation. The illustrations make the explanation more interesting and easy to understand.

3. [Memory Management Loading and Linking](http://labe.felk.cvut.cz/~stepan/AE3B33OSD/OSD-Lecture-6.pdf)<br>
The lecture material explains about memory loading and linking, along with process memory allocation, problem of thrashing, paging, etc.

4. [Contiguous Memory Allocation](https://binaryterms.com/contiguous-memory-allocation-in-operating-system.html)<br>
BinaryTerms.com gives good and comprehensive explanations about contiguous memory allocation, the advantages and disadvantages, and more. It also provides some illustrations so you can understand the explanations better.

5. [Paging](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. GFG gives you a good explanation about paging with some illustrations.

6. [Memory Protection](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~diesburg/courses/cs3430_sp14/sessions/s12/s12_memory_protection.pdf)<br>
The slides from Sarah Diesburg explains about memory protection in kernel and user address spaces. Memory protection keeps user programs from crashing one another and the OS.

7. [Page Table](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-page-table)<br>
JavaTPoint gives a good explanation about page table and also provided with some illustrations, makes it more understandable. Page Table is a data structure used by the virtual memory system to store the mapping between logical addresses and physical addresses.

8. [Fragmentation](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-fragmentation-and-what-are-its-types)<br>
Fragmentation is an unwanted problem where the memory blocks cannot be allocated to the processes due to their small size and the blocks remain unused. The website gives a comprehensive explanation about fragmentation.

9. [Swapping](https://binaryterms.com/swapping-in-operating-system.html)<br>
BinaryTerms gives good explanations about swapping in OS. Swapping is one of the several methods of memory management. In swapping an idle or a blocked process in the main memory is swapped out to the backing store (disk) and the process that is ready for execution in the disk, is swapped in main memory for execution.

10. [Difference between x86 and x64 Architecture](https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/02/24/what-is-x86-architecture-and-its-difference-between-x64/)<br>
Have you ever come across x86 and x64 but do not know what they mean? No worries, as that blog (the link above) will cover everything you need to know about x86 and its architecture together with x64 and their differences between each other.
