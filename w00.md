# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [How a Computer Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA)<br>
The link above will direct you to a TED-Ed video. The video explains about what happens inside a computer when it does "something". It briefly illustrates about the peripherals, the input/output subsystem, and the CPU, as well as human-written programs and memory. The animation and visualization in the video makes the topic more intriguing to learn.

2. [Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GDX-IyZ_C8)<br>
Another YouTube video, but this time, it tells you about the essential concepts of Operating Systems. In this 23-minute video, you'll get simple yet comprehensive explanations about the basic concepts of OS and how OS works.

3. [Memory Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
The website tells you about Memory Management in Operating Systems. It explains about process address space, swapping, static vs dynamic loading & linking, memory allocation, and more.

4. [Processor Management](http://www.uobabylon.edu.iq/eprints/publication_11_2045_44.pdf)<br>
The PDF contains a lecture of Process Management from Dr. Sura Z. Alrashid. It explains about process concepts such as process state, process control blocks, and threads. It also explains about process scheduling and operations on processes.

5. [File System Management](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)<br>
The website gives you brief yet complete explanations about file system, including its properties, file structures, file attributes, file access methods, space allocation, and many more.

6. [Mass Storage Management](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/10_MassStorage.html)<br>
Referenced from the Operating System Concepts book made by Silberschatz et. al., the website gives you clear and comprehensive explanations about Mass-Storage Structure, Disk Scheduling, Swap-Space Management, RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) Structure, and more.

7. [Device Management](http://mkics.in/MKICS/Notes/FY/SEM-2/OS/Device-Management.pdf)<br>
The PDF tells you more about Device Management equipped with figures and illustrations to help you understand more about the topic.

8. [Interrupt](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Introduction/OSworking.html#:~:text=Interrupts%20are%20signals%20sent%20to,part%20of%20the%20operating%20system.&text=Hardware%20Interupts%20are%20generated%20by,some%20attention%20from%20the%20OS.)<br>
An operating system is interrupt driven. The website explains about the basics of how operating systems work, highlighting Role of Interrupts, CPU Execution Mode, and CPU Response to Interrupts.

9. [Virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8A9PHeyRrY)<br>
The video breaks down virtualization. It explains about virtualization basics, hypervisors, virtualized networking, and the use cases. A good 18-minute video that helps you understand about virtualization.

10. [Distributed Systems](https://blog.stackpath.com/distributed-system/)<br>
A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user. The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.
