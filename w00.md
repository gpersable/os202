# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm)<br>
Operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware. Operting system (OS) controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users (Silberschatz et. al.). OS performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers. 

2. [Memory Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.

3. [Processor Management](https://zitoc.com/processor-management/)<br>
A process is a program in execution. An integral part of any modern-day OS. The OS must allocate resources to processes, enable processes to share and exchange information, protect the resources of each process from other processes and enable synchronization among processes ([Wikipedia](Wikipedia)). In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides which process gets the processor when and for how much time. This function is called process scheduling ([tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm#:~:text=has%20been%20terminated.-,Processor%20Management,processor%20and%20status%20of%20process.)).

4. [File System Management](https://tutorialspoint.com/File-System-Management)<br>
Files are used to provide a uniform view of data storage by the operating system. All the files are mapped onto physical devices that are usually non volatile so data is safe in the case of system failure. The information in a file can be accessed in various ways. The most common among them are using sequential access or direct access.

5. [Mass Storage Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Mass-Storage-Management)<br>
Mass storage refers to the storage of large amounts of data in a persisting and machine-readable fashion ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_storage)). Usually disks used to store data that does not fit in main memory or data that must be kept for a “long” period of time. Operating system performs mounting and unmounting, storage allocation, free-space management, disk scheduling, partitioning, and protection (Silberschatz et. al.).

6. [Device Management](https://zitoc.com/device-management/)<br>
An operating system manages device communication by their corresponding device drivers. Operating system holds track of all devices, I/O controller is used to perform this task. Operating system also allocates and deallocates devices, and it decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.

7. [Operating System Security](https://zitoc.com/operating-system-security/)<br>
Security refers to delivering a protection system to computer system resources such as CPU, disk, memory, software programs and most prominently data and information stored in the computer system. A computer system must be protected against un-authorized access, malicious access to system memory worms, viruses, etc. Systems generally first distinguish among users, to determine who can do what (Silberschatz et. al.).

8. [Interrupt](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Introduction/OSworking.html#:~:text=Interrupts%20are%20signals%20sent%20to,part%20of%20the%20operating%20system.&text=Hardware%20Interupts%20are%20generated%20by,some%20attention%20from%20the%20OS.)<br>
Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses of all the service routines. An operating system is interrupt driven. The operating system preserves the state of the CPU by storing the registers and the program counter. <b>Interrupt Handling</b>: separates segments of code determine what action should be taken for each type of interrupt (Silberschatz et. al.).

9. [Virtualization](https://opensource.com/resources/virtualization)<br>
Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware ([opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/virtualization)). It allows operating systems to run applications within other OSes. Use cases involve laptops and desktops running multiple OSes for exploration or compatibility, e.g. (1) Apple laptop running Mac OS X host, Windows as a guest, (2) developing apps for multiple OSes without having multiple systems, and (3) quality assurance testing applications without having multiple systems (Silberschatz et. al.).


10. [Distributed Systems](https://blog.stackpath.com/distributed-system/)<br>
A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user. The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.
