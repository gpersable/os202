# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm)<br>
Operating system is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware (Silberschatz et. al.).
Operating system (OS) performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

2. [Memory Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.

3. [Processor Management](https://zitoc.com/processor-management/)<br>
A process is a program in execution. An integral part of any modern-day OS. The OS must allocate resources to processes, enable processes to share and exchange information, protect the resources of each process from other processes and enable synchronization among processes ([Wikipedia](Wikipedia)). In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides which process gets the processor when and for how much time. This function is called process scheduling ([tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm#:~:text=has%20been%20terminated.-,Processor%20Management,processor%20and%20status%20of%20process.)).

4. [File System Management](tutorialspoint.com/File-System-Management)<br>
Files are used to provide a uniform view of data storage by the operating system. All the files are mapped onto physical devices that are usually non volatile so data is safe in the case of system failure. The information in a file can be accessed in various ways. The most common among them are using sequential access or direct access.

5. [Mass Storage Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Mass-Storage-Management)<br>
Mass storage refers to the storage of large amounts of data in a persisting and machine-readable fashion ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_storage)). Usually disks used to store data that does not fit in main memory or data that must be kept for a “long” period of time. The OS performs mounting and unmounting, storage allocation, free-space management, disk scheduling, partitioning, and protection (Silberschatz et. al.).
