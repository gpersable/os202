# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [How a Computer Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA)
The link above will direct you to a TED-Ed video. The video explains about what happens inside a computer when it does "something". It briefly illustrates about the peripherals, the input/output subsystem, and the CPU, as well as human-written programs and memory. The animation and visualization in the video makes the topic more intriguing to learn.

2. [Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GDX-IyZ_C8)<br>
Another YouTube video, but this time, it tells you about the essential concepts of Operating Systems. In this 23-minute video, you'll get simple yet comprehensive explanations about the basic concepts of OS and how OS works.

3. [Memory Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
The website tells you about Memory Management in Operating Systems. It explains about process address space, swapping, static vs dynamic loading & linking, memory allocation, and more.

4. [Processor Management](https://zitoc.com/processor-management/)<br>
A process is a program in execution. An integral part of any modern-day OS. The OS must allocate resources to processes, enable processes to share and exchange information, protect the resources of each process from other processes and enable synchronization among processes ([Wikipedia](Wikipedia)). In multiprogramming environment, the OS decides which process gets the processor when and for how much time. This function is called process scheduling ([tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm#:~:text=has%20been%20terminated.-,Processor%20Management,processor%20and%20status%20of%20process.)).

5. [File System Management](https://tutorialspoint.com/File-System-Management)<br>
Files are used to provide a uniform view of data storage by the operating system. All the files are mapped onto physical devices that are usually non volatile so data is safe in the case of system failure. The information in a file can be accessed in various ways. The most common among them are using sequential access or direct access.

6. [Mass Storage Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Mass-Storage-Management)<br>
Mass storage refers to the storage of large amounts of data in a persisting and machine-readable fashion ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_storage)). Usually disks used to store data that does not fit in main memory or data that must be kept for a “long” period of time. Operating system performs mounting and unmounting, storage allocation, free-space management, disk scheduling, partitioning, and protection (Silberschatz et. al.).

7. [Device Management](https://zitoc.com/device-management/)<br>
An operating system manages device communication by their corresponding device drivers. Operating system holds track of all devices, I/O controller is used to perform this task. Operating system also allocates and deallocates devices, and it decides which process gets the device, when, and for how much time.

8. [Interrupt](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Introduction/OSworking.html#:~:text=Interrupts%20are%20signals%20sent%20to,part%20of%20the%20operating%20system.&text=Hardware%20Interupts%20are%20generated%20by,some%20attention%20from%20the%20OS.)<br>
Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses of all the service routines. An operating system is interrupt driven. The operating system preserves the state of the CPU by storing the registers and the program counter. <b>Interrupt Handling</b>: separates segments of code determine what action should be taken for each type of interrupt (Silberschatz et. al.).

9. [Virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8A9PHeyRrY)<br>
The video breaks down virtualization. It explains about virtualization basics, hypervisors, virtualized networking, and the use cases. A good 18-minute video that helps you understand about virtualization.

10. [Distributed Systems](https://blog.stackpath.com/distributed-system/)<br>
A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user. The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.
